# Thrundaric Language System Enhancements

## 1️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture Enhancements  
Since you're using **EventBridge**, ensure the following:  
- [] **Refactor Lambdas** to process batched events instead of single entries (better performance)  
- ✅ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for failed events (AWS SQS or SNS)  
- ✅ **Monitoring & Logging** (AWS CloudWatch to track ingestion issues)  

## 2️⃣ Query & Retrieval System  
Once words and rules are stored, **you need a way to retrieve and use them**:  
- ✅ **GraphQL or REST API** to expose the dictionary & grammar rules  
- ✅ **Search Indexing** (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for efficient lookups)  
- ✅ **Precomputed Relations** (e.g., "Find all verbs derived from root X")  

## 3️⃣ AI-Based Language Agent 🤖  
An AI **agent** that interacts with the API to manage language creation and retrieval:  
- ✅ **Conversational API Access** (Chat-based interaction for querying Thrundaric rules, words, or grammar)  
- ✅ **Automated Word Suggestion** (AI suggests new words following phonotactic rules)  
- ✅ **Grammar & Syntax Validation** (AI verifies whether a sentence is grammatically correct)  
- ✅ **Query Expansion** (Understands user intent, reformulates queries for deeper analysis)  
- ✅ **Adaptive Learning** (Learns new linguistic patterns from user interactions)  

## 4️⃣ Word Formation & Generation  
A dynamic **word generator** can ensure consistency when adding new words:  
- ✅ **Morpheme-Based Word Synthesis** (build new words dynamically using stored morpheme rules)  
- ✅ **Root-Based Word Derivation** (e.g., generate related words based on defined transformations)  
- ✅ **Phonotactic Constraint Checker** (to enforce language sound rules)  

## 5️⃣ Writing System (Orthography) ✍️  
Thrundaric needs a **custom writing system**, leveraging AI to assist in character creation:  
- ✅ **AI-Generated Glyphs** (AI produces new Thrundaric characters based on phoneme mappings)  
- ✅ **Automated Character Storage** (Systematically stores and indexes glyphs for retrieval)  
- ✅ **Writing System Rules** (Defines how phonemes map to characters, handling diacritics, ligatures, etc.)  
- ✅ **Font & Script Generation** (Create a unique script or font for digital use)  
- ✅ **Handwriting Recognition** (Train AI to recognize written Thrundaric symbols)  

## 6️⃣ Sentence Parsing & Construction  
To **validate sentence structure** in Thrundaric and construct new sentences:  
- ✅ **Parser** (validates if a sentence follows Thrundaric syntax rules)  
- ✅ **Sentence Generator** (given a meaning, generate Thrundaric sentence structures)  
- ✅ **Rule Conflict Detection** (check if new grammar rules contradict existing ones)  

## 7️⃣ Machine Learning / AI Integration  
For advanced language features and usability:  
- ✅ **Language Model Training** (Train a small model for natural Thrundaric sentence generation)  
- ✅ **Speech Synthesis & Recognition** (Convert written Thrundaric to speech & vice versa)  
- ✅ **Handwritten Input for Thrundaric** (AI deciphers handwritten words and translates them)  

## 8️⃣ Developer & User Tools  
To make Thrundaric accessible and usable:  
- ✅ **Web-based Dictionary & Grammar Explorer**  
- ✅ **CLI or API for automated word lookup & validation**  
- ✅ **Interactive Language Learning Tool** (think Duolingo for Thrundaric!)  

## 9️⃣ Data Validation & Versioning  
- ✅ **Versioned Rulesets** (allow rollback of grammar changes)  
- ✅ **Audit Logs** (track changes to grammar rules, word entries, etc.)  

## 🔥 Future Expansions  
- ✅ **Text-to-Image Generation for Script Visualization**  
- ✅ **Thrundaric Name Generator** (Create character names following phonetic rules)  
- ✅ **AI-Assisted Storytelling** (Generate texts in Thrundaric based on prompts)
